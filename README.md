Hello, I’m @RichardSchrader a passionate electronic engineer.
I’m interested in machine learning, IoT, openCV, Drones, Robots and all programmable electronic devices: microcontrollers, FPGAs, Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano, Arduino and etc.
I’m currently improving my programming skills working in some personal projects. Some of them I pretend to post here to share and learn.
I’m looking to collaborate on any cool and challenge project involving electronic design and programming.
You can reach me by LinkedIn.
